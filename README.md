# Closed_Loop_Opto_Stimulation Paradigm
Closed-loop optogenetic stimulation paradigm that utilizes Bonsai and DeepLabCut-Live pose estimation to manipulate spinal circuits based on the phase of the rodent locomotor cycle

# Plot_indiv_traces
This script plots the indivudal trace of the toe trajectory according to the normalized step cycle from 0 to 1. 

# Compare_avg_traces
This script compiles the tracked videos per control and experimental mouse and plots the average trajectories with +/- SEM according to the normalized step cycle. 

# Stick_plot_150fps
This script plots the stick plot trajectory of all user defined joints during the completion of one step cycle.
